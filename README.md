# PixelArt
Personal Project:
I wanted to revisit an old project from OOP(Object Oriented Programing) in Java where we had to make Pixel art by using Javaswing.
The objective was to create a class with methods to place certain number of pixels and to set colors.
I wanted to solve this on C++ using the SFML framework but I wanted to design it in a way so that you can set it up and change it during run time
This is a very basic version of the program and I plan to add more features for the user.
